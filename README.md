# A-Cool-FPS
A well-made FPS (server-only) that I made. It will constantly receive support and updates, as
it is my biggest project right now.

## Status and prerequisites

Current status at a glance:
```
Unity version: 2018.3 beta 12 
Platforms    : Windows (client and server) and Linux (server only)
```

## Size Information
**Requires LFS to clone.**
```
~50-60 MB (GitHub repository)
~110-120 MB (Cloned local repository, packed by Git/GitHub)
~36 GB (Cloned local repository, fully unpacked, no Git/GitHub state cleanup) 
~26.5 GB (Cloned local repository, fully unpacked, middle-level Git/GitHub state cleanup is performed
~21 GB (Cloned local repository, fully unpacked, top-tier Git/GitHub state cleanup is performed
*~17 GB (Built and compiled, no compression: best performance)
*~6 GB (Built and compiled, middle-level compression: requires a decent PC)
*~4.5 GB (Built and compiled, max compression: requires a beefy pc)

NOTE: Add 6-7 gigabytes to starred (*) states, if you built a standalone instead of running it through Unity.
```
